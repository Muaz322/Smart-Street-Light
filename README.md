# Smart-Street-Light

Smart Street Light System

Description:

•	In this project we will use the IR sensor to detect the user presence and turn the light on and off.

•	You can also create this project using PR light sensor the nature of project would change in that project the light would operate if pr sensor senses any light or not basis.

NOTE: This code is only using one ir sensor and one led you can use multiple
